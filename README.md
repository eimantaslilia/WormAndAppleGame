# WormAndAppleGame

This is a classic Worm Game.

Package domain helps us create the apple, and the worm from pieces.  
Package game has all the game logic in it: If the worm runs into the apple, the worm grows by one piece. If it runs into itself, or into the border, the worm game ends. The game becomes faster whenever the worm grows.  
Package gui creates the graphical user interface for the game, and adds the features of controlling the game with keyboard arrows.
